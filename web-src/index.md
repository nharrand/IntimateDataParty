# Welcome to the Intimate Data Party

This small website should give very simple code snippets to get started with your data exploration and visualizations, in Python (with [Matplot lib](https://matplotlib.org)), in R (with tidyverse and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)) and JavaScript (with [Plotly JS](https://plotly.com/javascript/)).

Each of these libraries provide excellent data visualization capabilities. The point of this documentation is not to replace th

### Phase I: Data exploration

 * Choose a product or service and consider the data they collect. It can be something you already use, are interested in, or have stopped using.
 * What type(s) of data do they collect? How often?
 * Which person is the data associated with? Think broadly about people who could be directly or indirectly captured in the data.
 * What information could be inferred from the data? About whom?
 * What other actors could be interested in this data? Why?
 * What data is "essential" for the product or service to function, and what is not?


### Phase II: Design (Pick one of the following briefs)

 1. Imagine you’re redesigning the product or service so it doesn’t collect unnecessary data. What would that look like?
 2. Design an alternative data representation (e.g. data visualization, physicalization, sonification) that incorporates important information that the product or service fails to capture from the data it collects.
 3. Design a dystopic application that exploits the data from all the other people captured by the data. What could it do?
 4. Design a product or service re-identifies people from their data. What could you infer about them?
